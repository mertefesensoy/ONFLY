# ONFLY

ONFLY simulates the sugar-to-feeding circuit of the male fruit fly: a
501-neuron subcircuit taken from the MaleCNS v1.0 connectome, run with the
leaky integrate-and-fire model of Shiu et al. (2024) in a portable C89 engine
with a COBOL batch driver. On MVS, whose System/370 architecture has no IEEE
floating point, the engine does its IEEE 754 arithmetic in software (Berkeley
SoftFloat), and the nineteen golden requests give the same fingerprints on
every platform in the table below, from x86-64 to MVS 3.8j running under an
emulator.

> **ONFLY has not run on IBM Z hardware. The project does not have IBM Z
> access yet.** Every MVS result in this repository comes from MVS 3.8j
> running under the Hercules emulator, and every s390x result from Linux
> running under QEMU, both on one x86-64 laptop. Nothing here has run on
> z/OS or on IBM CICS Transaction Server.

The specification, every decision and every verification limit are in
[`docs/ONFLY-SRS.md`](docs/ONFLY-SRS.md). A shorter account is
[`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md), and [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
suggests where to start reading.

then F and H.

Determinism, the golden fingerprints of the nineteen Section 8.4 requests
(SRS Section 8.3):

| Row | Platform | Floating point | Compiler | Requests matching |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | x86-64 | Python reference | none | 19 of 19 |
| 2 | x86-64 | native | MinGW gcc 6.3.0 | 19 of 19 |
| 3 | x86-64 | SoftFloat 3e | MinGW gcc 6.3.0 | 19 of 19 |
| 3b | x86-64 | SoftFloat 2c | MinGW gcc 6.3.0 | 19 of 19 |
| 4 | Linux s390x under QEMU | SoftFloat 3e | gcc 13.3.0 | 19 of 19 |
| 5 | Linux s390x under QEMU | native | gcc 13.3.0 | 19 of 19 |
| 6 | MVS 3.8j under Hercules | SoftFloat 2c | GCCMVS 3.2.3 | 19 of 19 |
| 7 | MVS 3.8j under Hercules | SoftFloat 2c | JCC 1.50.00 | 19 of 19 |
| 8 | z/OS | | | empty |

On MVS the response records are identical to the x86-64 ones byte for byte
apart from one text field that MVS stores in EBCDIC. Identical fingerprints
show that the platforms agree with each other; they do not show that any of
them is correct.

## What you can reproduce today

**1. Check the recorded evidence.** Needs Python 3 and the files in this
repository; it compares recordings, it does not re-run them.

```
python tests/run_tx.py --compare data/phase-d/x86w data/phase-d/s390x
python tests/run_mvsrun.py
python tests/run_mvsjcc.py
```

**2. Build and run the x86-64 suite.** Not yet possible from a clone. The
suite needs the two network files, `srext` (171,768 bytes) and `path`
(951,200 bytes), which are not distributed yet; their digests are in
[`data/networks/MANIFEST.json`](data/networks/MANIFEST.json). On x86-64 it
has been run only with the recorded toolchain, 32-bit MinGW gcc 6.3.0 on
Windows, with GNU Make and Python 3.13 with numpy and pandas:
`mingw32-make fixtures && mingw32-make testfloat && mingw32-make test`.

**3. The emulated labs.** Linux s390x needs your own QEMU guest; the MVS rows
need your own TK5 system on Hercules and hours of emulated CPU. The 3270
demonstration cannot be reproduced from this repository at all, because the
transaction monitor it runs under, INTERCOMM, is under a non-commercial
licence and is kept out of this tree.

Tested platforms: x86-64 Windows 11 with 32-bit MinGW gcc 6.3.0; Linux x86-64
(Ubuntu 26.04 under WSL2, gcc 15.2.0; SRS VL-140); Linux s390x (Ubuntu 24.04,
gcc 13.3.0) under QEMU; MVS 3.8j under SDL Hercules 4.9.1 with GCCMVS and
JCC. macOS and arm64 are untested.

## Limits

* **The science was measured on x86-64 only.** On x86-64, sugar at 40, 60,
  120 and 200 Hz made the MN9 feeding motor neurons fire in all 30 seeds at
  every rate, and zero sugar produced zero spikes in all 501 neurons. MVS
  shows the fingerprints agree, not the science directly.
* **The subcircuit carries one fitted input term** standing in for the
  neurons it leaves out. With it, the 501-neuron subcircuit stays within 10%
  of the MN9 rate of the 184,099-neuron annotated MaleCNS network (39.0% of
  its synapses) at 40, 60, 120 and 200 Hz; 10 Hz is excluded because that
  network's rate is too variable there to test against. At 40 Hz the margin
  is smaller than the reference's own standard error, and a campaign
  re-measured with new seeds is estimated to pass 52 to 60% of the time.
* **Agreement with Shiu et al. is in shape, not magnitude.** Compared with
  their model of the female FlyWire connectome, re-run from their published
  code, ONFLY's model on the annotated MaleCNS network rises with sugar in
  the same shape but fires more at low rates: 3.67 Hz at 10 Hz where the
  reference is silent, and 14.35 Hz against 4.73 Hz at 40 Hz. No single
  synaptic weight removes that gap.
* **Two acceptance criteria were changed after we saw the results:** ACC-3
  no longer tests 10 Hz, and ACC-4 no longer tests magnitude. Both changes
  and the failing numbers are recorded in the specification (D-202, D-340,
  D-341).
* **The s390x results come from Ubuntu 24.04 under QEMU's
  instruction-by-instruction emulation.** They show the code gives the same
  results on a big-endian system, and say nothing about floating point on
  real s390x hardware.
* **Performance figures are emulator figures.** Under Hercules 4.9.1 on an
  Intel Core i7-13650HX laptop, one standard 1000 ms request on the shipped
  network used 161 s of emulated CPU, inside the project's 10-minute budget.
  That is one run and says nothing about IBM Z performance.
* **The transaction is written in real `EXEC CICS` and runs on x86-64
  Windows under Raincode's CICS-compatible runtime, not under IBM CICS.** Its
  menu-screen program has never executed for lack of a licence, and running
  it concurrently is untested. On the emulated MVS lab, typing a request on a
  3270 session under INTERCOMM, a transaction monitor that is not CICS,
  starts an ONFLY batch run and then shows its result and golden
  fingerprint.
* **The emulated MVS job streams its spike data to the host while it is
  still running**, and for the five shipped-network golden requests that
  stream is byte-identical to the x86-64 one once line endings are
  normalised. Comparing those streams line by line exposed a GCCMVS
  code-generation fault that had turned every +0.0 in the MVS kernel into a
  tiny subnormal, a difference no fingerprint had caught; it is worked
  around, not fully characterised.

## How the project is built

ONFLY is built with an AI coding agent, Anthropic's Claude Code, working from
the specification. The agent drafts code, tests and documentation and runs
the builds and the lab jobs. The owner makes every decision: each is recorded
with the alternatives offered in the specification's decision log (Appendix
A.1), and the agent's own proposals are kept apart (Appendix A.2) until the
owner decides them. A result is recorded only from a command actually run,
with its output, its platform and what it does not prove (Appendix D).
Commits carry the owner's name alone (D-478).
